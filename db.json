  "name": "Dengue",
  "question": "What is Dengue?",
  "Overview": "Dengue is a viral disease. It is transmitted by the infective bite of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. These mosquitoes also spread Zika, Chikungunya, and other diseases. Man develops disease after 5-6 days of being bitten by an infective mosquito. Infected person with Dengue becomes infective to mosquitoes 6 to 12 hours before the onset of the disease and remains so upto 3 to 5 days.Dengue is caused by one of any of four related viruses: Dengue virus 1, 2, 3, and 4.  A person can be infected with dengue multiple times in their life.",

  "name": "Chikungunya",
  "question": "What is Chikungunya?",
  "Overview": "Chikungunya virus is spread to people by the bite of an infected mosquito. The most common symptoms of infection are fever and joint pain. Other symptoms may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, or rash. Outbreaks have occurred in countries in Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, and the Caribbean, Indian and Pacific Oceans. There is a risk the virus will be spread to unaffected areas by infected travelers. There is currently no medicine to treat chikungunya virus infection.",
  "transmission": "Chikungunya virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, most commonly Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti and Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus, which can also transmit dengue and Zika viruses. These mosquitoes bite primarily during daylight hours. They lay eggs in containers with standing water. Both species feed outdoors, and Aedes aegypti also feeds indoors. When an uninfected mosquito feeds on a person who has CHIKV circulating in their blood, the mosquito can ingest the virus. The virus then replicates in the mosquito over several days, gets to its salivary glands, and can be transmitted into a new human host when the mosquito bites them. The virus again begins to replicate in this newly infected person and reaches high concentrations in their blood, at which point they can further infect other mosquitoes and perpetuate the transmission cycle",
  "measure1title": "Vaccination",
  "measure1description": "No vaccine or medication is available to prevent chikungunya virus infection or disease. Reduce mosquito exposure by Using air conditioning or window/door screens, using mosquito repellents on exposed skin, wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, wearing permethrin-treated clothing. Empty standing water from outdoor containers. People suspected to have chikungunya or dengue should be protected from further mosquito exposure during the first week of illness to reduce the risk of further transmission. People at increased risk for severe disease should consider not traveling to areas with ongoing chikungunya outbreak.",
  "risk1": "Mosquito Exposure: Being in areas where Aedes mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, are present increases the risk of chikungunya virus transmission.",
  "risk2": "Travel: Traveling to regions where chikungunya is endemic or experiencing outbreaks increases the risk of exposure to the virus.",
  "risk3": "Outdoor Activities: Spending time outdoors, especially during periods of peak mosquito activity, increases the likelihood of being bitten by infected mosquitoes.",
  "risk4": "Lack of Personal Protection Measures: Not using mosquito repellent, wearing long-sleeved clothing, or sleeping under mosquito nets in endemic areas increases the risk of mosquito bites.",
  "risk5": "Urban Settings: Urban environments with dense populations and inadequate mosquito control measures can facilitate the spread of chikungunya virus.",
  "risk6": "Climate Factors: Weather conditions such as high temperatures and rainfall can influence mosquito populations and their activity, affecting the risk of chikungunya transmission.",
  "risk7": "Age and Health Status: While people of all ages can be infected, older adults and individuals with weakened immune systems may be at higher risk of developing severe symptoms.",
  "risk8": "Previous Exposure: Previous infection with chikungunya virus can confer immunity to subsequent infections, reducing the risk of reinfection and severe illness. However, individuals who have not been previously exposed are more susceptible to infection.",

  "Overview": "Malaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite that infects a certain type of mosquito. Most people get malaria from the bite of an infective mosquito. Malaria can be a deadly disease if not diagnosed and treated quickly. Starting treatment as soon as possible can often prevent severe illness and death. There are 4 types of malarial parasites namely Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malaria and Plasmodium ovale.",
  "type1": "Plasmodium vivax",
  "type2": "Plasmodium falciparum",
  "type3": "Plasmodium malaria ",
  "type4": "Plasmodium ovale",
  "transmission": "Malaria is transmitted through the bite of an infective Anopheles mosquito. These mosquitoes typically bite between dusk and dawn. The parasites multiply in the liver and then infect red blood cells, causing symptoms. Traveling to endemic areas, mosquito exposure, lack of personal protection measures, time of outdoor activity, living conditions, immune status, healthcare access, and drug resistance are all factors contributing to the transmission of malaria.",
  "measure1title": "Personal Prophylactic Measures",
  "measure1description": "Early diagnosis of fever and taking complete radical treatment will prevent transmission of malaria parasites. Wear loose-fitting, long-sleeved shirts and pants.
