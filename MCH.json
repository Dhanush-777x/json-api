      "title": "Pregnancy's Hurdles: Common Complications Explained",
      "Desc": "Key factors contributing to maternal mortality in India include complications during childbirth such as haemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, infections, and unsafe abortion practices. Additionally, inadequate access to skilled healthcare providers, poor infrastructure, socioeconomic disparities, and limited education on reproductive health contribute to the high maternal mortality rate in the country. Most primary postpartum haemorrhage results either from failure of the uterus to contract and remain contracted or from retained placenta (partial or complete). WHO has recommended that midwives be trained to perform manual removal of the placenta, because the results in terms of blood loss, infection and mortality are best when this is done within an hour of delivery."
